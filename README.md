# Udacity-MLND-Project-0
Applying machine learning to Titanic data, to predict survival with >80% accuracy

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to gain introductory exposure to basic machine learning concepts, by building a simple model for predicting whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or did not. This project was completed as the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Project 0.

## Key Results
By building a model that takes into account a passenger's gender and age, prediction accuracy increased from about 61% (the baseline scenario of always predicting a passenger did not survive) to approximately 80%.
